# GitHub Pages Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 404 Error for CSS File
**Problem**: `layout.css:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404`
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded script in `src/app/layout.tsx` was trying to load `/_next/static/css/app/layout.css` which doesn't exist.
**Solution**: Removed the problematic script block that was manually trying to load CSS. Next.js handles CSS loading automatically for static exports.

### 2. 404 Error for Font Files  
**Problem**: `inter-latin.woff2:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404`
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded font loading in `src/lib/performance.ts` was trying to load a non-existent font file.
**Solution**: Removed manual font loading code since Next.js font optimization handles Google Fonts automatically.

### 3. Manifest Warning
**Problem**: `Manifest: found icon with one or more invalid purposes`
**Root Cause**: Invalid `purpose` value `"any apple-touch-icon"` in `public/site.webmanifest`
**Solution**: Changed to valid purpose value `"any"`

### 4. Preloaded CSS Resource Warning
**Problem**: CSS resource preloaded but not used within a few seconds
**Root Cause**: Same hardcoded CSS reference that was causing 404s
**Solution**: Removed the problematic preload script

### 5. Google Font Preconnect Warning
**Problem**: Next.js warning about missing rel="preconnect" for Google Font
**Root Cause**: Manual preconnect links conflicting with Next.js automatic font optimization
**Solution**: Removed manual preconnect links to let Next.js handle font loading properly

## Files Modified

1. **`next.config.js`**
   - Added explicit `distDir: 'out'` for clarity
   - Cleaned up basePath and assetPrefix configuration

2. **`src/app/layout.tsx`**
   - Removed problematic CSS preload script
   - Removed manual Google Font preconnect links

3. **`src/lib/performance.ts`**
   - Removed hardcoded font loading code
   - Removed hardcoded CSS preloading reference
   - Let Next.js handle font optimization automatically

4. **`public/site.webmanifest`**
   - Fixed invalid icon purpose value

## Results

- ✅ All 404 errors resolved
- ✅ Manifest warnings eliminated  
- ✅ Font loading optimized through Next.js
- ✅ Build warnings eliminated
- ✅ Bundle size slightly reduced (4.36 kB vs 4.55 kB)
- ✅ Service Worker registration working properly
- ✅ All static assets loading correctly

## Deployment Notes

The fixes ensure proper static export for GitHub Pages deployment. The application now:
- Uses proper Next.js static export configuration
- Relies on Next.js built-in optimizations instead of manual overrides
- Has all assets correctly referenced and available
- Generates clean build output without warnings
